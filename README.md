## Introduction

TI-JS lets you run TI-Basic programs in the browser (by acting as a compiler/runtime, not through emulation).

Currently working on expanding the [grammar](src/parse/tibasic.peggy), so this is in prerelease.

Check out the [project page](https://www.davidtorosyan.com/ti-js/) and the [test suite](https://www.davidtorosyan.com/ti-js/tests/), or [playground](https://www.davidtorosyan.com/ti-js/playground/).

## Setup

To build, use node.

```sh
npm install
npm run build # production build
npm start # dev build, experiment at localhost:9080/playground/
```

## Usage

In progress, check back later.

If you're eager, poke around the [web](web/) and [sample][sample/] directories for examples.
